# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Description

This respositorty contains the Password Generator code which allows employees to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code which follow these instruction:

```
- Generate a password when the button is clicked
  - Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    - Length of password
      - At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
    - Character types
      - Lowercase
      - Uppercase
      - Numeric
      - Special characters ($@%&\*, etc)
  - Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  - Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

Using what I had learned in both class and self study I was able to create functioning application code which is both readable and DRY.
